            <h1>The command line</h1>
            <p>We'll cover commands that you'll need to know for navigating and manipulating the file system. There will be many other ways that you might want to use the command line for other specific objectives but they'll be covered under more specific subject areas.</p>
            <h2 id="nav-file">Navigating the file system</h2>
            <h3>Print working directory</h3>
            <code>pwd</code>
            <p>This command is used on its own without any options. It will give you the complete path for the working directory.</p>
            <h3>List contents of working directory</h3>
            <code>ls</code>
            <p>This command can be used on its own or with other options. On its own, it will list the contents of the working directory. Other options are as follows:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><code>ls -a</code> This lists <strong>all</strong> contents, including hidden files and folders.</li>
                <li><code>ls -l</code> This lists the contents of the working directory in long format.</li>
                <li><code>ls -t</code> This lists the contents of the working directory by the time they were last edited.</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <h3>Change directory</h3>
            <code>cd</code>
            <p>This command is always used with the relative path that you wish to navigate to. Some examples are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>cd child-directory</code> This assumes there is a folder within the working directory called 'child-directory'. The command will change to this directory.</li>
                <li><code>cd ..</code> This navigates to the parent directory of the current working directory using '..' as shorthand for going up one level.</li>
                <li><code>cd ../feet/right-foot</code> This navigates up one level and then into a 'feet' directory and then into a 'right-foot' directory.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="create">Creating files and folders</h2>
            <h3>Make directory</h3>
            <code>mkdir</code>
            <p>This command is always used with the name of the directory you wish to create. Note that the directory will be created within the working directory and that if there are any spaces in the directory name then the name must be in quotation marks.</p>
            <h3>Create new file</h3>
            <code>touch</code>
            <p>This command is essentially identical to the 'mkdir' command above, except that it will create a file rather than a folder. This means that an appropriate filetype extension should be applied along with the filename.</p>
            <h2 id="move">Moving and renaming</h2>
            <h3>Copy</h3>
            <code>cp</code>
            <p>The copy command can either copy one or more files. The command is used along with at least two options - the file(s) that are being copied and the destination. Some examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>cp file-one.txt file-two.txt</code> This copies the contents of 'file-one.txt' into 'file-two.txt' where they are both in the working directory.</li>
                <li><code>cp animals/shark.txt fish/</code> This copies the file 'shark.txt' from the 'animals' directory into the 'fish' directory.</li>
                <li><code>cp animals/crow.txt animals/eagle.txt birds/</code> This copies both 'crow.txt' and 'eagle.txt' files into the 'birds' directory. Note that both this example and the one above assumes that you are currently in the parent directory of 'animals', 'fish' and 'birds' given the relative file paths.</li>
                <li><code>cp * ../comedy/</code> This assumes that you are currently in a directory named 'satire' and you are copying all of the contents into another directory called 'comedy' at the same level in the filesystem.</li>
                <li><code>cp m*.txt scifi/</code> This assumes that you are currently in a directory named 'action' and you are copying all files beginning with the letter 'm' into another directory called 'scifi' which is a sub-directory of 'action'.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Move</h3>
            <code>mv</code>
            <p>This command can be used for both moving a file and renaming a file. When moving files, the 'mv' command is similar to the 'cp' command - akin to 'cut' and paste vs. 'copy' and paste.</p>
            <p>To move files, the command is used with one or more file names as the first argument and a destination directory as the last argument:</p>
            <code>mv matrix.txt matrix-2.txt matrix-3.txt scifi/</code>
            <p>To rename a file, the command is used with one existing file name as the first argument and the new file name as the last argument:</p>
            <code>mv matrix-2.txt matrix-reloaded.txt</code>
